        <p>The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them." - Albert Einstein. It is only through knowledge that man 
            attains immortality. Knowledge has to expand or grow to remain knowledge. The road to excellence is toughest, roughest and steepest in the Universe. The world requires and 
            honors only excellence. Available information has to be directed by wisdom and intelligence to create new knowledge. Promotion of creativity is the new role of education. 
            It is only through creative thinking that the present and future problems can be addressed to find dynamic solutions. Technology should be used to help remove poverty from 
            the world. In fact 40% of the world's poor are in India. Confidence leads to capacity. It is faith in oneself that produces miracles. Education at ACOE helps build Character, 
            Strengthen the mind, expand the intellect and establish a culture of looking at problems in a new perspective. The student is put through rigorous training so that he can stand 
            on his own feet after leaving the portals of the Institute.</p>
